[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/opentable/puppet-nsclient.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/opentable/puppet-nsclient)


##Module Description
Module that will install the NSClient on windows servers to be able to interact with Nagios and Icinga.
It will also manage the list of hosts that the server can communicate with.

##Setup

###What nsclient affects

* Installs a new package
* Creates a new windows service

###Beginning with nsclient

Usage
--
To install nsclient with defaults:

```puppet  
include 'nsclient'
```

To install a different version:

```puppet
class { 'nsclient':
  package_source_location => 'http://myhost.com',
  package_name            => 'NSClient++ (Win32)'
  package_source          => '0.3.1.msi'
}
```

In order to configure the nagios hosts to communicate with:

```puppet
class { 'nsclient':
  allowed_hosts => ['10.21.0.0/22','10.21.4.0/22'],
}
```

##Usage

###Classes and Defined Types

####Class: `nsclient`
One of the primary classes of the nsclient module. This class will install the nsclient binaries

**Parameters within `nsclient`:**

Array of hosts that your client can communicate with. You can use netmasks (/ syntax) or * to create ranges.

#####`service_state`
Whether you want to nsclient service to start up. Defaults to running

#####`service_enable`
Whether you want to nsclient service to start up at boot. Defaults to true

#####`download_destination`

Because of Windows, we need to set this to be a top level directory (e.g. c:\\temp) or we would need to
recursively check the file path.
